    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // one way

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    cap3.number = 40;
    cap3.string = 'string2';
